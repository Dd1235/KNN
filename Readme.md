# Machine Learning - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains applications of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It includes both custom implementations and applications using scikit-learn for classification and regression problems.

## Files

- [Apply KNNClassifier.ipynb](Apply%20KNNClassifier.ipynb): Application of KNN for classification on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
- [knn_classification.ipynb](knn_classification.ipynb): Custom implementation of KNN algorithm for classification.
- [Apply KNNRegressor.ipynb](Apply%20KNNRegressor.ipynb): Application of KNN for regression on the Diabetes dataset using scikit-learn.
- [knn_regression.ipynb](knn_regression.ipynb): Custom implementation of KNN algorithm for regression.

## Details

- **Custom Implementations**: `knn_classification.ipynb` and `knn_regression.ipynb` showcase the manual implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification and regression tasks respectively. These implementations provide a deeper understanding of how KNN works from scratch.
- **Applications with scikit-learn**: `Apply KNNClassifier.ipynb` and `Apply KNNRegressor.ipynb` demonstrate the use of the KNN algorithm from the scikit-learn library for classification and regression tasks. These notebooks showcase the practical application of KNN using a well-established machine learning library.

## Datasets Used

- **Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset in machine learning containing samples of Iris flowers, with features including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It is used for classification tasks.
- **Diabetes Dataset**: A dataset containing various health measurements of diabetes patients, used for regression tasks to predict disease progression.
